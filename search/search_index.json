For full documentation and tutorials, visit EasyFlowQ's Documentation Site . Overview A user friendly GUI interface for analyzing flow cytometry data. The program is implemented by Qt/Python, and its UI logics are largely influenced by the original matlab version of EasyFlow (by @ayaron) . The fcs file parser is based on the FlowCal package , with slight modification for implementing into the GUI. The standalone installers are packaged by PyInstaller and InstallForge . Download and usage You can either install EasyFlowQ via the provided installers, or run it directly with python ( Anaconda installation required). Method #1: Use the provided installer (Windows or MacOS) Please refer to release page (see below) to download the latest standalone packages for your operating system (MacOS or Windows) and install EasyFlowQ. In most case, you should be able to run it without other dependency. Special note for MacOS users: you will need to ctrl/right-click the app and select open for the first time after you put the app into the \"Application\" folder. The system will remember it as an exception for later time (see here ). Method #2: Run from python (a python installation is needed) For running the program from the source, download the whole code and run the command below. Standard Anaconda should be sufficient for running the program. Path/To/Folder$ python ./main.py Contact For more info please contact yma2@caltech.edu","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-easyflowq","text":"EasyFlowQ is an open-source, user-friendly flow cytometry analyzer with graphic user interface (GUI).

For more examples, please visit our Tutorial page. First time setup Upon the first time start, EasyFlowQ will greet you with the setting window (see below). If this is your first time using EasyFlowQ, we recommend you only change the first setting ( Default fcs directory ). Click browse and select the top-most folder that you normally keep your flow cytometry data. The EasyFlowQ will always open this directory when you load sessions or fcs files, and it will speed up your analysis workflow. The other settings you can change in this page include: Limit total number of dots : Decrease the number if refreshing of dot plot is slow. Plot DPI scaling : Tweak this if your plots' font and marks are unreasonably small or large. Generally tweak this number up will make font larger. This is only applied to the plotting region! Click the \"Default\" button if you want to reset all settings to default. If you encounter a \"Permission Error\" pop up after clicking \"OK\". That suggest you likely do not have the permission to write in the installed directory. The settings are not saved but you can continue to use the program and do analysis. To correct this, run the program as administrator. Don't worry if you missed this. This setting window is always available in the settings menu.","title":"Basic usage"},{"location":"Basic%20Usage/#basic-usage","text":"This page will describe the basics of using EasyFlowQ, including basic settings, loading sessions and FCS files, as well as basic analysis method.

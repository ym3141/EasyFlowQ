# Welcome to EasyFlowQ!

## Overview
A user friendly GUI interface for analyzing flowcytometry data. The program is implemented by Qt/Python, and its UI logics are hugely influenced by the original matlab version of [EasyFlow (by @ayaron)](https://github.com/AntebiLab/easyflow). The basal fcs parsing are based on the [FlowCal package](https://github.com/taborlab/FlowCal), with slight modification for implementing into the GUI. The standalone packages are packaged by [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

## Download and usage
**Method #1:** Please refer to [release page](https://github.com/ym3141/EasyFlowQ/releases/) to download standalone packages that can run on either MACOS or Windows. In most case, you should be able to run it without other dependency.

**Method #2:** For running the progam from the source, download the whole code and run the commend below. Standard Anaconda should be suffecient for running the whole code.
```
Path/To/Folder$ python ./main.py
